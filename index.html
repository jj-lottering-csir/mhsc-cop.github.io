                        The Mining Occupational Health Advisory Committee (MOHAC) of the Mine Health and Safety Council (MHSC)
                        revised the current “Guideline for the compilation of a mandatory COP for an occupational health programme on personal
                        exposure to airborne pollutants” that was published by the DMR in 2002. The result was the revised “Guideline for the
                        Compilation of a Mandatory Code of Practice: Occupational Health Programme on Personal Exposures to Airborne Pollutants”
                        (DMR 16/3/2/4-A1 effective 30 April 2018) (Herein referred to as the “Guideline”)

                        A decision was made by MOHAC to issue an Operations Manual with the revised guideline. The aim of the
                        operations manual is to assist the end-user with the development and implementation of the Code of Practice. The following

                        The Commission of Inquiry into Safety and Health in the Mining Industry chaired by the Honourable Mr.
                        Justice R N Leon identified occupational health as one of the four major issues affecting occupational
                        health and safety in the mining industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To address this issue a tripartite sub-committee was established under the auspices of the Mining
                        Occupational Health Advisory Committee (MOHAC). MOHAC found it necessary to address this issue in that a guideline for a
                        mandatory COP for Airborne Pollutants is drafted.

                        Significant risks to health exist in mining. In order to protect, monitor and promote employees’ health
                        status, an occupational health programme is required where exposure to such significant risks occur. MOHAC considered
                        it appropriate to prepare a guideline covering both occupational hygiene and medical surveillance to ensure
                        compliance and uniform standards.

                        occupational hygiene measurements or a system of medical surveillance, or where either such system is required by regulation, the
                        employer must prepare and implement a COP based on this guideline.

                        The first component of any management system is finding out what the situation is, the second is deciding what to do
                        about it.

                <p>
                    In accordance with section 9(2) of the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) an employer must prepare and
                    implement a COP on any matter affecting the health and safety of employees and other persons who may be directly affected by
                    activities at the mine if the Chief Inspector of Mines (CIOM) requires it. These COPs must comply with any relevant
                    guidelines issued by the CIOM [section 9(3) MHSA]. Failure by the employer to prepare or implement a COP in compliance with this
                    guideline is a breach of the MHSA.

                    Inspector of Mines (CIOM) is required to issue guidelines on any matters affecting the health and safety of workers at
                    mines. Such guidelines are issued in consultation with the MHSC. Codes of practices (COPs) are then drawn-up by each mine

                    terms and definitions that are related to the Assessment of Workplace Exposure to Chemical and Biological Agents.
                    These are either general terms or are specific to physical and chemical processes of air sampling, the analytical method or
                    method performance. The terms in ISO 18158 are those that have been identified as being fundamental because their
                    definition is necessary to avoid ambiguity and ensure consistency of use. ISO 18158 is applicable to all International
                    Standards, Technical Reports, Technical Specifications, and Guides related to Workplace Air Quality. Some ISO 18158

                    The definition was revised to emphasise that HEGs should be classified based on statistical data. Some international documents refer to similar exposure groups (SEG).

                    BOHS/NVVA (2011): SEGs are defined as “A group of workers having the same general exposure profile for an agent because of the similarity of the materials and processes with which they work, and the similarity of the way they perform the task(s).”
                    Mulhausen and Damiano (2006). These SEGs can be established either by observing the work activity or by using a "sampling approach" that consists of creating the SEGs on the basis of a statistical analysis of the exposure data (Mulhausen and Damiano (1998)).
                    <br /><br />
                    EN 689 (1996): The preferred approach is to subdivide the exposed population into homogeneous groups with respect to exposure. The variability of exposure levels is smaller for well-defined groups than for the exposed workforce as a whole. Thus, where a group of workers is performing identical or similar tasks at the same place and has a similar exposure, sampling such as representative of the group may be carried out within that group.

                    ISO 18158 definition:<br />
                    ➢ measuring procedure/measurement procedure/measurement method: set of operations described specifically for the sampling and analysis of chemical or biological agents in air (Usually includes preparation for sampling, performance of sampling, transportation and storage, and sample preparation for analysis and performance of analysis).
                    <br /><br />
                    Measuring is the sampling and analysis of the pollutant to determine exposure. Sampling is the act of capturing the pollutant in the workplace. The analysis step is the characterisation and quantification of the pollutant that was captured.
                    Measuring is not a once-off act but is a ongoing process over time to determine if the controls that were implemented, are effective.

                    Definition for mixtures: The Guideline does not specify a definition for “mixtures”. However, for the purpose of drafting a COP it is important to have internal definitions or descriptions for mixtures based on the context as it applies to the different workplaces.
                    Guidance on certain terms regarding mixtures is provided below:<br />
                    •&nbsp; Aggregate exposure: same chemical from multiple sources and/or multiple pathways<br />
                    •&nbsp; Combined exposure to multiple chemicals: multiple chemicals through a single or multiple source<br />
                    •&nbsp; Assessment group: chemicals grouped together for evaluation as combined exposure.<br />
                    •&nbsp; Chemical mixture: combined exposure to multiple chemicals regardless of source; may or may not be identified. May contribute to joint toxicity in a target population.<br />
                    •&nbsp; Intentional mixtures: manufactured products<br />
                    Different methodologies for assessing exposure to multiple compounds are discussed in a publication by Bopp et al (2018).
                </p>
                <p>
                    “NIOSH” means the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (United States);
                </p>
                <p>
                    “qualitative” means observations or information characterised by measurement on a categorical scale (i.e. dichotomous or nominal scale) or, if the categories are ordered, an ordinal scale e.g. “low”, “medium”, “high”.
                </p>
                <p class="prettyprint">
                    “Qualitative” will be relevant to a walk-through survey where observations are made, and an initial categorisation of exposure is made based on theoretical assumptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “quantitative” means data in numerical quantities such as continuous measurements or counts e.g. percentile, rates.
                </p>
                <p class="prettyprint">
                    “Quantitative” refers to actual measurements that were taken to quantify the exposure. The outcomes of the quantitative measures are compared with the qualitative and used to evaluate future assessments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “occupational exposure limit (OEL)” means the TWA concentration for an 8-hour work day and a 40 hour work week to which nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse health effects;
                </p>
                <p class="prettyprint">
                    It is important to note that an OEL is not the same as the “Milestone Targets”. Milestones refer to the agreement that was signed between the State, Industry and Labour at the 2014 Occupational Health and Safety Summit. The milestone relevant to Airborne Pollutants is:
                    “By December 2024, 95% of all exposure measurement results will be below the milestone level for respirable crystalline silica of 0.05 mg/m3 (these results are individual results and not average results).” Milestones provide a measure for all stakeholders to monitor progress on the journey to achieve zero harm. The milestone is not a legislative requirement however, the OEL’s for Airborne Pollutants are contained in one of the regulations of the Mine Health and Safety Act.

                    “sampling cycle” means the planned sampling programme for the year, which must terminate at the end of each calendar year;
                </p>
                <p class="prettyprint">
                    The sampling cycle refers to the 12-month period 1 January to 31 December for which the monitoring and sampling strategy is valid.

                <p>
                    “TWA” means Time Weighted Average; and “90th percentile” means the statistical value of exposure data which must be used to determine when HEG’s need to be re-classified, calculated either by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        using Microsoft Excel programme (percentile function); or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        first placing all sample results in order from the lowest concentration to the highest concentration (i.e., concentration of specific contaminants). Next, assign each sample result a number, starting with the number 1 for the lowest concentration result up to the highest concentration being given the number equal to the total number of samples collected in that HEG. Multiply the total number of samples collected by 0.9. The sample result with the number corresponding to this calculated value is the 90th percentile.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="prettyprint">
                    It is important to note that annual HEGs are re-classified based on the 90th percentile of the pollutant concentration or the 90th percentile of the Air Quality Index (AQI) (whichever is greater). Refer to the Reporting Tutorial for guidance on how to calculate and use this percentile value.
                    <br />
                    The quarterly HEGs are classified based on the 90th percentile of pollutant concentration or AQI (whichever is greater). Refer to the Tutorials for guidance on how to calculate and use this percentile value.

                            The COP should describe how the pollutants identified as per 5.2 are monitored and controlled even though it is not a requirement to report personal exposure to the DMR. For example, diesel exhaust was classified as a human carcinogen but there is no established OEL in South Africa yet. Personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) (used as the marker for diesel exhaust) should be controlled and monitored and the information should be readily available on request by the DMR.

                        <div class="prettyprint">
                            Obtain and keep record of the evidence of consultation. Evidence may be in the form of written comments by the representatives. If a meeting was held then the minutes of meeting should reflect detailed comments from each representative to ensure that the body of evidence from the committee is comprehensive. A good way to document the evidence of consultation is to create a Commenting Table where members can comment in writing on the COP (refer to Table 1). All comments are collated in one document and kept for future reference.

                                The Act supersedes the Guideline. Maintain evidence in the form of appointment letters for each member of the committee.
                                The letters should clearly outline the associated duties and responsibilities of each member of the committee.
                                In the absence of a stakeholder representative on the committee, there should be evidence that all stakeholders were consulted to ensure sufficient representation of the workforce.<br /><br />
                                If a commenting tool is used instead of meeting minutes, the individual(s) that has/have the authority to accept or reject comments, should be clearly stated in appointment letter(s).

The employer must determine how the significant risks identified in the risk assessment process must be dealt with, having regard to the requirement of section 11(2) and 11(3) that, as far as reasonably practicable, attempts should first be made to eliminate the risk, thereafter to control the risk at source, thereafter to minimise the risk and thereafter, insofar as the risk remains, to provide personal protective equipment and to institute a programme to monitor the risk.

                                        Qualitative risk assessment: Process of obtaining an initial, high-level overview of the risk of exposure. Methods that are employed are walk-through surveys, screening or semi-quantitative measurements and visual observation. Once a high-level risk assessment is completed, a quantitative risk assessment can be done.

                                        Quantitative risk assessment: Process of quantifying or measuring the risk more accurately. The first time a quantitative risk assessment is carried out, it is usually called the “Baseline Risk Assessment (BRA)”. This assessment is used as the starting point at which improvements are made and controls are implemented.

                                        Continuous monitoring and assessment are the ongoing, quantitative assessment of employee exposure according to the sampling plan for the year. Monitoring includes the sampling (capture) and analysis (characterisation) of a pollutant.

                                        Periodically it may necessary to review the BRA. Five years is a suggestion but depending on the situation at your operation, it may be sooner (3 years) or even later (8 years). Document the review period and update the BRA as required.

                                                It is compulsory to conduct a Baseline Risk Assessment (BRA) and maintain evidence of the BRA and not only describe the process. The baseline is the quantitative risk assessment where accurate concentrations are determined, and a specific risk value is assigned to each significant pollutant (i.e. pollutants in concentrations above the specified limits as per the scope of the guideline)

In processing plants, some raw materials can combine to form additional airborne pollutants.

                                                        It is important to note that different forms of the pollutant may have different OELs and Pollutant Codes (refer to Annexure A):
                                                        <img src="./assets/images/8-3-1-2-d_Table4.png" style="height:100px;width:auto;margin-top:20px;" />

                                                        The nature of the pollutant will also determine the sampling method e.g. gravimetric sampling using a filter and cassette for particles as opposed to sorbent tubes for gases.
                                                        The COP should describe how pollutants that do not have OELs are dealt with such as diesel particulate matter (DPM).

                                                        Take note of the operation or activities that give rise to the presence of exposures to the pollutant e.g. drilling causes dust. Diesel engine operation results in diesel engine emissions being produced; however, the pollutant concentration will vary based on the operation of the vehicle (i.e. idling vs. operating under load). The ventilation system might disperse the pollutant to other areas and increase employee exposure in other areas. During the risk assessment the different operations or activities should be assessed to determine which exposure condition poses the greatest risk to the employee.

                                                        The risk assessment should be done in line with employees and their occupation i.e. employees who are at risk. The risk assessment is not limited to occupations in Annexure A and should include the occupations that are not listed in Annexure.<br /><br />
                                                        It is important to note the following:<br /><br />
                                                        The proximity of the employee to the source and the time spent in this proximity should be considered when assessing the risk of exposure. Proximity and duration are easy to determine for operators directly at the source for the full shift. However, for roving personnel these two parameters should be well defined.

                                                        Below are some examples of how to define the pattern of exposure:

                                                            Continuous (chronic, repeated, uninterrupted) exposure may be defined as a full working shift i.e. 8 hours per day, 5 days per week or 40 hours per week; depending on how the shift cycles are arranged.
                                                        </li>

                                                            Periodic exposure may be defined in relation to the nature of the occupation e.g. exposures to welding fumes occur for approximately 10 minutes every hour during a full shift. This type of exposure may be relatively predictive and may occur at fixed intervals.
                                                        </li>

                                                        When measuring the actual exposure levels the assessment must be representative of employee exposure for each shift. Different shifts may have different exposures due to the manner in which operations are carried out or to the extent that control measures are effective during the shift. It shouldn’t be assumed that all shifts have the same exposure levels unless sufficient statistical evidence supports such an assumption.

The measurement result that is obtained, with an established and acceptable uncertainty, is compared to the national OEL or international limits for the pollutant in question.

                                                        The qualitative risk assessment provides an indication of where samples need to be taken for the quantitative risk assessment. More samples will be required for the risk assessment when qualitative exposure results are equal to or above the OEL than for qualitative results below 50% of the OEL. As a general rule, EN 689 recommends that at least 1 in 10 employees are measured in a HEG.

                                                        The risk assessment must describe the control measures that are already in place for each pollutant, which additional control measures should be implemented. The efficiency of control measures may be assessed using direct-reading instruments and the quantitative assessment. Examples of control measures include air-filtration units, water and chemical sprays systems, haul road dust control system, local exhaust ventilation systems etc. PPE should not be considered as a permanent control system. It should at most only be used while rectifying existing controls or while implementing new controls. Refer to Table 2 for an example.

Alternatively, bulk ore samples can be sent for qualitative analysis to a testing laboratory and the results may be useful during the risk assessment.

                                                The COP should explain how the personal exposure monitoring results from the previous cycle will be evaluated to determine a need for a review of the risk assessment. Develop criteria for the review that are relevant to your operation e.g. if more than five HEGs have changed to a higher category then the risk assessment requires a review.

                                                When conducting a baseline risk assessment, it is important to clearly define the context, conditions and circumstances under which the assessment was done (according to section 8.1.1) for future reference. When the baseline is reviewed for whatever reason, the context must be documented with enough detail so that the review can be done on the areas affected by change. Keep in mind that the user of the historical documentation may not be the same person that was the original compiler of the documents. Figure 3 provides an example of typical information that are useful to document, but the list is not exhaustive. Review and update the register of reference documents if necessary.

                                        HEGs should be identified for purposes of personal exposure monitoring. The baseline risk assessment will enable the identification of HEGs, which will be established as follows:

                                                It is impractical to assess the personal exposure of every single employee. For this reason, the employee population is divided into HEGs (or sometimes referred to as Similar Exposure Groups (SEGs)). However, it is critical that the HEGs are representative of the individual exposure, within the allowable limits of between-worker variability. The baseline risk assessment informs the HEG determination.

                                                The objective of this COP is to describe a programme that must protect the health of the employees. The objective should not be to do meaningless sampling, but sampling should be representative of the exposure profile. The employer is required to provide the necessary resources for the continued sampling according to Section 7 of the Mine Health and Safety Act.

                                                For example, in Europe there is more emphasis on the Risk Assessment than on the Continuous Monitoring. If the Risk Assessment is comprehensive, then better and more effective controls can be implemented. The Continuous Monitoring should then confirm the effectiveness of the control and not be used as a reactive measure.

                                                At underground mines sampling areas should be subdivided into ventilation districts which are areas of a mine, ventilated independently from other areas with a common dedicated intake and return airways. Any airborne contaminants released in a ventilation district will only affect that particular district and does not circulate through other areas of the mine where people may be exposed.

For example, the intake air for a Continuous Miner Section is drawn from the main ventilation district, polluted during operation and then the return from this section contributes to the main ventilation district of the next or another ventilation district.

When comparing personal exposures to national OEL or international limit values, keep in mind that a specific reference period was used for the OEL, normally this is based on an 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek. Current South African legislation does not refer to adjustments of an OEL to take different working schedules into account.

                                                It is important that additive effects of pollutants are discussed with the relevant Occupational Medical Practitioner, Epidemiologist and Toxicologist. The decision and reasoning should be clearly documented for future reference as the combined effect should never be assumed.

                                                Brouwer and Rees (2016) commented on this approach in their letter to the editor of the Occupational Health Southern Africa Journal. The AQI formula assumes that all the pollutants
                                                in the mixture have the same action and contributes to the toxicity of the mixture in the ratio present. However, the solubility and size distribution of particles are different, and they tend to deposit in different areas of the respiratory system; or be removed by the body’s mechanisms. Non-soluble particles deposit in the respiratory system, end up in the lungs, but may be transferred to other organs in the body. OELs were derived with a specific target organ in mind because pollutants have a localised toxicity such as on the lungs, brain and kidney. When insolubility and localised toxicity are considered, then additive effects may be assumed for the purposes of the risk assessment and exposure monitoring.

Employees are however frequently subjected to mixed exposures. It is therefore necessary to take into account the possible additive or synergistic effects of these pollutants. Due to the difficulty in assessing if the effects of a mixture of pollutants are either additive or synergistic, the requirements of this COP will be to treat all such cases as if they are additive. With all types of mixed exposures, it is essential that the classification band category assessment should be based on the concentrations of each of the constituents in air to which employees are exposed.

                                                        Define “mixtures of pollutants” for your operation;
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Consult with the relevant Occupational Medical Practitioner, Epidemiologists and Toxicologists to evaluate the mixtures to assess which mixtures are truly additive and/or synergistic.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Other occupational exposures such as noise, vibration and heat may have to be considered as having a synergistic effect with airborne pollutants e.g. exposure to certain metals and noise. In these instances, a different approach may be required.
                                                    </li>

                                                It is very important that a record keeping system is maintained that will assist the Section 12.1 appointee during the evaluation and interpretation of exposure data (refer to Section 8.1.5.1).

                                                        Mining is dynamic and the working conditions are constantly changing; it is important to maintain the inventory of control measures (refer to Section 8.3.5). If the control measures are changed from one type to another (i.e. dry filtration to water sprays), records should be kept of when, where and what the impact of these changes were. These records will be critical when exposure results have to be evaluated and interpreted.

When employees complain about excessive exposures or changes in the nature of the airborne pollutant in their workplace (e.g. smell, colour etc.), the Section 12.1 appointee should investigate the cause of these changes. These changes may require the re-assessment of the HEG’s.

Confirming the accuracy of the exposure category as poor quality control during sampling or analysis may result in an exposure that is not representative of the employee exposure. However, if the change in the exposure category is valid, re-assess the HEGs as this will have an impact on the sampling frequency and sampling size. A comprehensive statistical analysis and review may be useful to confirm the validity of the HEGs.

These factors may require the re-evaluation of some HEGs.

International legislation usually changes as a result of scientific research that provides sufficient evidence to support a reduction of a national OEL or international limit value, for example. The Section 12.1 appointee should take note of such changes even though it is not legislated in South Africa yet.

                                                            for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures” as follows: “The application and appropriate use of knowledge gained
                                                            from the formal education, experience, experimentation, inference, and analogy. The capacity of an experienced professional

                                                            comprehensively and to make use of standardised and validated methodologies, procedures or checklists that will result

                                                A sampling strategy is an approach to measure the exposure of a pre-defined number of employees in each HEG over a period of 12 months. This strategy should be designed in such a way so as to provide sufficient evidence to show compliance with national OEL’s or the relevant international limit value. This strategy includes all information related to the HEG classification, number of individuals in a HEG, the number of samples to be taken from a HEG (depending on the exposure concentration of the pollutant) etc.

                                                        information. It is important to determine the nature of the pollutant and how sampling should be done e.g. metal fumes
                                                        are not sampled in the same way as gases.

                                                        records or a register of the individuals or facilities who take ownership of a sample during the entire process
                                                        (i.e. blank preparation to chemical analysis result). During each step of the process the person taking custody of the sample
                                                        is responsible for the protection of the integrity of the sample. This is especially important when sampling equipment
                                                        changes hands during the process.

                                                        For example, the gravimetric sampling train is prepared by the weighing facility → given over to the Pump Issuer → sampling
                                                        train given to the employee being assessed → employee carries sampling train (or leaves it unattended) → sampling train returned
                                                        to Pump Issuer → Sampling train returned to weighing facility. This is a simple example with only a few steps, however,
                                                        in reality the entire sampling process may consist of a multitude of steps. Each step contributes some variability that
                                                        may impact on the outcome of the exposure assessment.

                                                            When selecting a facility for an accredited service, carefully review the accreditation schedule of the facility.
                                                            Confirm that the accredited service that is required is included in the scope of accreditation. Ensure that the
                                                            methods are accredited for the type of samples to be submitted. For example, elemental analysis of dust is not the
                                                            same method as elemental analysis in water samples. Please confirm with the facility for which type of samples that
                                                            their method was validated.

                                                It is recommended that the Quality System is aligned with the organisational quality system. It is important to note that some
                                                technical aspects related to the personal monitoring may not be covered by the organisations quality system.

                                                    ISO 9001 Certification: A quality system that requires policies and procedures to be in place to ensure that organisational practices are consistently executed to a high standard. This certification ensures that products and services are comparable with internationally recognised practices. Most mining companies may already have ISO 9001 Certification (and others) in place. ISO 9001 is systems orientated and compliance based i.e. have a system and follow it. What this means is that exposure assessment results may be produced according to a set of procedures – but there may be no measure of the integrity of the outcomes.

                                                    ISO 17025 Accreditation: A quality system that requires policies, procedures and records to assure that valid and reliable results are consistently produced. This quality system is technology orientated and competency based i.e. have a system, follow it and have proof of the integrity of results. What this means is that there is a system to ensure that valid, accurate and reliable results are produced by the weighing facility, for example. This system applies to testing and calibration facilities however, the management and technical requirements may be useful to the mine.

                                                    ISO 17020 Accreditation: A quality system that requires policies, procedures and records to assure that impartial and valid assessments are carried out in compliance with a standard or regulation. This system is similar to ISO 17025 but have additional requirements for procedures where an inspection is carried out against legislative standards/regulations. For the purposes of this guideline, the assessment will be personal exposure to airborne pollutants in compliance with national regulations. The requirements of the standard will assist the user to assess and manage the aspects that may have a negative impact on the quality of exposure assessment results.

                                                The accreditation standards can be used as a guideline to develop procedures and implement the standards to assure the quality of exposure assessment results. An organisation may consider applying for accreditation with the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS) at a later stage or if deemed necessary by the mine management.

                                        The COP should document the duration of shift cycles and be updated as changes are made in these cycles. It is important to realise that when shifts become longer (i.e. from 8 to 12 hours) that employees are exposed to airborne pollutants for longer and the subsequent exposure concentrations may be higher. Due to the operational activities the exposures may differ between day and night shift. The aim should be to obtain reliable concentrations employee exposures in all shifts and take samples that represent the HEG.

                                            When ISO 17020 and/or 17025 is used as a guideline to establish an occupational hygiene quality system, the training requirements will be
                                            easy to identify. Each link in the chain of events to assess the personal exposure of employees to airborne pollutants will require
                                            specific competencies from each individual in that chain. In this context “competency” can be described as the ability to carry out an
                                            action to ensure that the integrity and quality of the exposure assessment is maintained. Training requirements may be included in
                                            the organisation’s performance evaluation process.

                                            Training should address areas where a lack of knowledge exists and should aim to standardize practices. Inconsistencies in the execution
                                            of procedures will harm the integrity of the exposure assessment process.

                                            It is important to document how training planned and executed when it is not under the direct control of the mine. For example, what is
                                            the criteria of the facility chosen for training, how will assessments be carried out and what is the expectation from the mine in terms of

                                                        Depending on the number of employees in the organisation, the training of the wearer of equipment may become very complex.
                                                        It may be worthwhile to develop short induction/training sheets for each type of sampling. The issuer may explain the sampling
                                                        and highlight critical aspects that may have an adverse effect on the quality of the data i.e. the sorbent tubes should not
                                                        be submerged in water. A copy of the training sheet may then be issued to the wearer for reference. Alternatively, a ‘shadow’
                                                        may be appointed to follow the wearer and make sure that sampling is carried out according to plan. It may be sensible to
                                                        find a workable solution within the organisation through the Health and Safety Structure of the mine.

                                                        The manner in which equipment is transported depends on the operations of a mine. In some cases sampling equipment may be
                                                        handled by hand and in some cases, there is no other alternative but to make use of a courier. Training should be specific
                                                        and focused on areas that will impact on the quality and integrity of the samples. Specify the requirements in the service
                                                        contract when the transportation of sampling equipment is done by a courier i.e. handle with care, keep cold, deliver within

                                        In this Section the user is required to describe the different control measures that are implemented. This information should be maintained
                                        and updated as circumstances change. This information will be valuable when the exposure measurement data is evaluated.

                                        When reporting to the DMR an explanation should be given for over-exposures. It is not sufficient to only state that a control failed. The
                                        root cause of the over-exposure should be reported and the corrective action that was taken. During the next reporting a follow-up should
                                        be reported. It is suggested that this explanation is done in the form of a summary table similar to a high-level 11.5 investigation report.

                                        To determine the root cause of the over-exposure, start with a simple process of asking the question “Why?” until the root cause is determined.
                                        The corrective action should address the root cause in order to prevent the over-exposure from occurring again. If the same type of control
                                        failed in two different HEGs it does not necessarily mean that the root cause is the same.

                                        was identified e.g. the engineering control for one pollutant may be different for another pollutant. On investigating the failure of controls
                                        one might find that one control is more effective on one pollutant than on another.

                                                the user must be able to access historical data when requested by a DMR Inspector during an audit. Readily available means that a
                                                document should be retrieved within an hour from the initial request. It is recommended to have a document registry and maintain it
                                                as new documents are created.

                                                Detailed records are important when trying to find the relationship between personal exposure measurements and the components of the
                                                risk assessment or changing circumstances. The integration of information from the different departments and/or disciplines at the
                                                mine, may assist the user to evaluate and interpret personal exposure measurements.

                                There is currently not a standard method that provides guidance on how to link medical surveillance data with occupational hygiene measurements. At
                                best, exposure measurement concentrations for an individual can be linked to his/her medical records via the Human Resources system using a
                                unique identifier such as the employee’s national identification number, passport number or company staff number.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One example of linking exposure to the medical surveillance records is to create a database for each exposed employee that contains the personal
                                nr, pollutant, exposure concentrations, type of and the values obtained during the medical surveillance. Find a pragmatic way to record and store
                                the information for long-term safekeeping. When the employee leaves the employ of the mine, this information has to be summarised on the DMR 275
                                Record of Hazardous Work form.

                                                    The Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act 78 of 1973 (known as “ODMWA) and the Compensation for Occupational Injuries
                                                    and Diseases Act (Act 130 of 1993) (known as “COIDA”) have specific legislative requirements. However, it is recommended that
                                                    once pollutants are identified during the Risk Assessment, that a table is created that lists the pollutant, the target
                                                    organ, associated illnesses and diseases, and the associated medical surveillance (e.g. blood, urine or x-rays). In this manner the
                                                    Occupational Medical Practitioner can make an informed decision on the type of medical surveillance required for specific
                                                    occupations. In some cases, one test may cover a number of pollutants e.g. chest x-rays can be used to assess diseases ranging
                                                    from exposure to different pollutants. Below are examples of tables that can be developed to keep a register and can be
                                                    integrated with Table 3 for a comprehensive review of pollutants.

                                                    high-risk individuals and decide on the most appropriate medical surveillance.
